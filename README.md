My Codewars Journey ðŸš€
Hi there! Welcome to my repository of solved Codewars problems. This collection serves as a personal log of my progress and solutions.

My Motivation
I'm using Codewars to actively improve my problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking. My primary goal is to build a solid foundation for the technical challenges I'll face in my university courses and to prepare myself for a future career as a programmer. Each 'kata' solved is a step forward in that journey.

What is Codewars?
Codewars is a great online platform where developers can train on programming challenges known as 'kata'. These challenges are created by the community and cover a wide range of skills and difficulty levels, helping to sharpen coding techniques across various languages.

Repository Structure
The solutions in this repository are organised by the programming language used and then by their kyu (difficulty) level. This helps keep things tidy and makes it easy to track my progress from simpler problems to more complex ones.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to browse through my solutions.
